# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug: Missing or Incorrect Keys

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component: rendering issues caused by missing or incorrect `key` props for list items.  The bug and its solution are presented in separate files.

**Bug:**
The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases a FlatList implementation with a missing or incorrectly assigned `key` prop. This leads to inconsistent rendering behavior when data updates occur.

**Solution:**
The `FlatListBugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected implementation with proper `key` assignment, ensuring efficient and correct rendering of list items.

**To reproduce the bug:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the erratic behavior of the FlatList in the initial implementation. 
5. Compare it to the solution for correct behavior.

This example illustrates the importance of providing unique and consistent keys for optimal performance and accuracy when using FlatList and other list-rendering components in React Native.
