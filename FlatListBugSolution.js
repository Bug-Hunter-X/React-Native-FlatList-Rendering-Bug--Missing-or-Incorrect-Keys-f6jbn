The solution lies in providing a unique `key` prop to each item rendered by the FlatList.  This key should be a unique identifier for each item in your data array. A good choice is often the item's ID from your data source.

```javascript
// Correct implementation
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View>
      <Text key={item.id}>{item.text}</Text> // unique key provided here
    </View>
  )}
/>
```

This ensures that FlatList can efficiently identify and update individual list items whenever data changes, preventing inconsistencies and rendering errors.
