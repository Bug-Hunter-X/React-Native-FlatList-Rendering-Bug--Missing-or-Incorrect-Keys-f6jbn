This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect or missing key prop for the items being rendered.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and recycle list items. Without unique keys, FlatList may not re-render items correctly when data changes, leading to incorrect display or unexpected behavior.  The error message itself might not be explicit, instead manifesting as seemingly random rendering issues or component state inconsistencies.
